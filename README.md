# availityTechnicalAssessment
This repo will be for the coding questions of the technical assessment of availity's backend job position.

Here i will also answer to the first 3 questions asked:

1.- My proudest professional achievement, so far, is when i became a tutor of a difficult programming class i attended during my college years, the thing is, the first time i took the subject called Digital Systems 2, i understood it quite easly, hence I thought that it didn't require much of my time and effort to pass it. i was wrong, really really wrong. I ended up failing the class. I felt stupid, I was mad at myself for letting my grades drop by something that was completly avoidable.
  So i took it again (i really had no other choice since my school required that class approved to move forward with every students credits), this time i noticed the teacher had made the dificulty level of the class a little bit higher, so my classmates were struggling to comprehend the basics, let alone anything else. That's when i started teaching the stuff no one understood, helping them with the class projects, the programming questions, the study sessions, everything.
  Needless to say i scored the highest of my class that semester, for the remaining year i went to that college until i went to an internship i continued to teach
  that class to whomever would contact me for tuition. It made me feel extremly fulfilled.
  
  
  
2.- To be honest, I have not read anything recently, the last thing I read was a novel by Stephen King called, The Last Stand, about 2 years ago which has become one of my top 5 novels to read and recommend to ANYONE. These days my main source of information is Youtube Videos and audiobooks, anything that it is spoken so that i can hear while i do other stuff. the most recent, that i would defnitely recommend, is a video series of DIY (Do It Yourself) channel called ChrisFixIt, which involves a guy inspecting, testing and solving all kinds of automobile issues and telling people how he goes around every problem he faces and how he solves it. for the mechanicaly inclined for sure a must see, for the curious of heart like myself too. It is awesome to see the thought process of someone troubleshooting life's problems the way a software developer would a pice of code, very very similar indeed, I am fascinated at the moment.



3.- Lastly, if i were to explain to my grandma what Availity does, it would be one of the funniest thing i'd had to do in a while (My grandma is a very sharp woman so nothing hardly ever escapes her and if something doesn't quite clicks she makes the funniest questions in order for her to comprehend in her own words what it is being taught) BUT in anycase, i would start by telling her how when a Health Provider needs to check a patients Health Plan to veriy anything, from elegibility to personal information associated with that account, they would have to use a Program much like Google to search and find these kind of information. Then i'd follow that by telling her that it doesn't end there because it seems that Availity can also provide the means to those very same Health Providers to do work with the insurance, and the patient, so that there are fewer mishaps in the processes of billing, attention, care, prescriptions, and a lot of other stuff.
