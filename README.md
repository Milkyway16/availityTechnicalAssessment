HOW TO MAKE IT WORK:

1- TO MAKE THIS CODE WORK WE ONLY NEED TO THINGS, ONE IS TO USE THE TEST.CSV FILE THAT IS IN THE SOURCE FOLDER OF THIS BRANCH AND
  EDIT IT SO IT CONTAINS THE TEST CASES OR RECORDS TO TEST THE CODE WITH
  
2- THE OTHER THING WE NEED IS THE NAME WITH THE .CSV EXTENSION READY TO PASTE IT WHEN THE PROGRAM RUNS BECAUSE IT WILL ASK
WHAT IS THE FILE NAME TO WORK WITH.

THE OUTPUT WILL BE DIFFERENT .CSV FILES, EACH ONE FOR EACH INSURANCE COMPANY PRESENT IN THE TEST CASE INSIDE THE FILE.
